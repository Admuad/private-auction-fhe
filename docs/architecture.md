# Private Auction Architecture (Zama Protocol)

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the **Private Auction Marketplace**, built using **Zama’s FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)** technology.  
The goal is to enable users to **create, bid, and verify auctions privately** while maintaining verifiable fairness and on-chain trust.

---

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
- **Framework:** Next.js or React
- **Features:**
  - Connect wallet (via WalletConnect or MetaMask)
  - Create new auction (encrypted metadata + FHE bid parameters)
  - Submit private bids
  - View decrypted results after auction close

---

### 2. Backend (FHE Service Layer)
- **Powered by:** Zama Protocol SDK
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Encrypt, compute, and verify bids under FHE
  - Manage key generation and re-encryption
  - Interact with smart contracts through adapters
- **Privacy:** No raw bids or values ever exposed

---

### 3. Smart Contracts (On-Chain Logic)
- **Chain:** Base or Optimism (EVM-compatible)
- **Roles:**
  - Store encrypted auction data and metadata hashes
  - Verify zero-knowledge proofs of correctness
  - Release result after decryption and verification
- **Language:** Solidity + Zama’s FHE-compatible libraries

---

### 4. Private Identity Layer
- **Purpose:** Prevent fake auction listings and spam
- **Built using:** Zama’s Private Identity SDK (zkID + FHE)
- **Flow:**
  1. User submits basic KYC proof or verifiable credential (encrypted)
  2. Identity service verifies privately under FHE
  3. User obtains a unique “Private Identity Token” (PID)
  4. PID is required to post or host auctions

---

### 5. Data Flow

1. User signs in → obtains **PID**
2. User creates encrypted auction listing
3. Bidders submit encrypted bids → processed by Zama FHE backend
4. Once auction ends, FHE service computes winner
5. Encrypted result verified → smart contract finalizes
6. Decrypted results published (with no private info leakage)

---

### 6. Tech Stack (Recommended)
| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Next.js, TypeScript, Wagmi, TailwindCSS |
| FHE Backend | Zama SDK, Node.js, Express |
| Smart Contract | Solidity, Hardhat or Foundry |
| Database | PostgreSQL / Supabase |
| Identity | Zama Private ID, Lit Protocol (optional) |

---

### 7. Security Principles
- All bids and user identities are **encrypted** using FHE
- Only aggregated or computed results are decrypted
- Users cannot link bids to real identities
- The protocol ensures **verifiable fairness** without sacrificing privacy

---

### 8. Future Extensions
- Encrypted messaging between bidders
- Private data marketplace integration
- Cross-chain auction settlement
- DAO governance for listing rules
